# Subway App

Intention is to build on Github user @jpwright project "subway" (original Github repo [here](https://github.com/jpwright/subway)) to create a more robust front end and gameplay experience (user accounts and the like), as well as to clean up the code and make the project more extensible.


## Set Up

Gulp is used for its watch feature, which allows modifications to watched JavaScript and CSS file changes to be compiled into the production publicly served files on the fly. All development related lirbaries are held in the `package.json` under the developer dependencies section. All other dependencies are held in the standard dependencies section of the `package.json`. Use `npm` to manage and install dependencies.
